Description: This program will generate a Rock paper scissors game allowing a user to play against the computer. A point will be awarded for each win, and the first player to lead by two points wins the overall match.

Technologies used: C# and Visual Studio 

As new developers, we watned to write a simple console app to start out. We hope to add text art graphics as we develop this. We may later make it more object-oriented and add a front end for a full-stack application.
